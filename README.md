# AceAi
AceAi is a light weight ai assistant for programmer's by the end of this I am hopping it could find stuff on GitHub and stack overflow and other flings if you want to help you are welcome to with any programming language.  

# Downloading
First download the zipfile from github and unzip it and take it in to your favourite code editor my favourite is visual studio code you can use overs but i like visual studio code
after that run the AseAi.py file and it should work but if it dose not please report it to the issues tab on github or add to the code if you it works the code is a bit messy but im going to clean it up at some point.

# Packages
I have used jarves ai for most of my project but if you look at the packages folder you will see a StrooAi file and i have edited jarves ai and added some features so if you are adding to the code i would check that out.

# Sounds
I added some sounds one of them is the beep noice for when you start the bot but there is also a gunshot noice which i added for some reason ill probably use it at some point but if you want you can add more noices i use playsound for all the sounds so please use that if you can.

# Using the code 
I am happy for people to take the code of the ai if you change it a bit but please don't take the code and steel it because that woluld be a bit anoying but you are free to take some or all of the code.

# What the code means
Again i will be changeing the code to make it easer to read and will be adding some # and other stuff to make it easy to read all you will need to know it lists os and jarves ai and my ai stuff which i talked about on the packages part.

Thanks for reading =).
